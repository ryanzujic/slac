        A class designed to represent a hit sequence aligned to the query gene's genomic and coding sequence, within
        a single continuous text string. This includes an abbreviated format called miniSLAC, which can fit within an
        near arbitrary character length, at the expense of resolution.

        Args:
            genomic: (str) the genomic sequence, aligned to the hit sequence.
            cds: (str) the coding sequence. Ideally this will be supplied aligned to the other sequences, however an
            unaligned CDS can be provided and aligned to the genomic sequence if required - and a simple algorithm
            will attempt to align it to the genomic sequence.
            hit: (str) the hit sequence, aligned to the genomic sequence.
            size_limit: (int) the maximum number of characters to display in the miniSLAC output. Default is 50.
            frequency_threshold: (float) the proportion of each abbreviated block upon which the miniSLAC is built,
            which must be the most common character, in order for the full version of that character to be used instead
            of the mixed character. Default is 1.0.
            Eg: The 10 character block of |||X|||||| will be abbreviated to the mixed character '!' if the frequency
            threshold is 1.0. If it was 0.8, it would be abbreviated to the full character '|'. You'll probably want it
            on the default to not miss details.
            display_mode: (str) the default display mode for the object. Must be one of: short, full, full_hit.
            Default is short (miniSLAC).
            auto_align_cds_to_genomic: (bool) if True, will attempt to align the CDS to the genomic sequence if the CDS
            is provided but not aligned. Default is False. if False, a provided CDS must be pre-aligned to the genomic.

        As we can assume the coding sequence will align to the genomic sequence with perfect identity, with gaps,
        the user can provide an un-aligned cds, we can perform simple kmer matching to determine how the cds
        aligns with the genomic, and retain full functionality of the tool.

        Disclaimer: This is not a full alignment tool and has not yet been tested in edge cases, particularly if
        insertions are common.

        Args:
            aligned_genomic: (str) the genomic sequence as aligned to the hit, if one was provided.
            cds: (str) the coding sequence
            kmer_size: (int) the size of the kmers to use for matching. We check kmer windows between the sequences and
            insert gaps in the CDS until each kmer matches the genomic sequence. When a subsequent kmer does not match,
            we retry with one size down until we reach 0, at which point we insert gaps until the next full kmer matches.
            This assumes that any exon is at least the size of the kmer. Default is 5.

        Assumes:
            The genomic sequences contains the full and exact CDS sequence.
            The CDS sequence does not contain gaps.
            No exons are smaller than the kmer size.

        Returns:
            (str) the CDS sequence with gaps inserted to align it to the genomic sequence
